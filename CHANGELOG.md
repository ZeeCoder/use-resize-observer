# CHANGELOG

TODO

- document how to get the raw element, now that we return a callback ref. (merge callback refs)
- update the size in the docs

## 7.0.0-alpha.1

- **[BREAKING]** The returned ref is now a callback ref, not a ref object
- **[BREAKING]** The returned ref will always be the same callback ref.
  Previously when a custom ref object was passed, it was returned as well from
  the hook as "ref".
- **[BREAKING]** Compared to 6.2.0-alpha.1 There's no `callbackRef` return value
  anymore.

## 6.2.0-alpha.1

- Only instantiating a ResizeObserver instance if there's actually something to
  observe. This for example means that if you pass in `null` or undefined as the
  ref, or if neither the default ref or callback ref returned from the hook are
  in use, then no ResizeObserver instance will get created until there's an
  actual element to observe. Resolves: #42
- The hook now returns `callbackRef`, which can be used in place of the usual
  `ref`. Use this instead of a normal ref, when the observed component is
  mounted with a delay. Resolves: #43, #45
- The `ref` option now accepts raw elements as well.
- Handling custom refs (through options), the default ref and the callback ref
  has been greatly refactored internally (into the `useResolvedElement`
  hook), to handle more edge cases with the way refs are handled.
- Tests based on react testing library were refactored to make them much simpler
  and more approachable.
- Fixed an error where in certain edge cases the hook tried to set state when
  its host component already unmounted.
- Added [contributing guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md)
- Overall bundle size increased a bit, due to the new features added.
  (With about ~150B or so.)

## 6.1.0

- No changes, only publishing the next minor.

## 6.1.0-alpha.3

- Fixed SSR rendering, and added a test to cover it.

## 6.1.0-alpha.2

- ResizeObserver instances are no longer created unnecessarily when the onResize
  callback changes. (Fixes #32)
- Written new tests in [react testing library](https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library).

## 6.1.0-alpha.1

- Rewrote the source in TypeScript. (Feedback is welcome.)
- Rewrote tests in TypeScript as well. (Ensures the types make sense.)
- Added checks to ensure reasonable bundle size.

## 6.0.0

- **[BREAKING]** Default width and height can now be set by declaring defaults
  for object destructuring, instead of having custom options for them.
  This means the following options were removed: `defaultWidth`, `defaultHeight`,
  `useDefaults`.
- **[BREAKING]** Due to the above, the default width and height will be
  `undefined` instead of `1`.
- Docs were updated to reflect the above changes.
- Added an `onResize` handler that can report size changes instead of the default
  object return. (This also helps implementing a more performant throttle /
  debounce solution.)

## 5.0.0

- **[BREAKING]** `#14` Removed the polyfill from the default builds, and shipping
  it instead as as separate module.
- **[BREAKING]** `#21` Returning an object instead of an array, so that values not
  needed could be omitted.
- `#18` Added missing copyright notice in the MIT license.
- Improved ref handling:
  - `#16` You can now pass in your own ref
  - The same hook instance can now be reused with different refs
  - The hook will no longer break if the ref is not immediately filled.
    (Anything other than an object with a `.current` value of an `Element` will
    be ignored.)
- Made defaults optional with the `useDefaults` option.
- New `package.json` scripts to ease development
- Added throttle and debounce guides to the readme
- More tests

## 4.0.0

- Added option to pass default width and height. Useful when using the lib with
  SSR. (Thanks [Simon Boudrias](https://github.com/SBoudrias) and
  [Fokke Zandbergen](https://github.com/FokkeZB))
- Dep upgrades
- **[BREAKING]** Removed TS types. See:
  - https://github.com/ZeeCoder/use-resize-observer/issues/12
  - https://github.com/ZeeCoder/use-resize-observer/pull/13
  - https://github.com/ZeeCoder/use-resize-observer/pull/8

## 3.1.0

## 3.0.0

- **[BREAKING]** Requires React 16.8.0 or above, which is the first non-alpha
  release that includes hooks

## 2.0.1

## 2.0.0
